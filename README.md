# The Tortoise Book Prize 

## Code Institute Milestone Project 3: Backend Development 
The Tortoise Book Prize Review Scheme that allows schools to engage with the book award, by students reading each of the nominated books and publishing reviews, under the supervision of their teacher. The website tracks how many books a student has reviewed, and readers are encouraged to review all nominations by offering a certificate of completion and a book token at the end. 

## Initial Design
### Strategy
## Owner Key Goals:
- to create engagement and grow interest in the Book Prize
- to build momentum for the announcement of the prize winner
- to spark conversation and critical analysis in the book nominees
- to encourage reading in students
- to give students an opportunity to write and share reviews
## User Key Goals
- to provide students with a supervised, safe online environment to publish their work
- to practise writing book reviews and articulating their views in a critical format
- to be able to reward students when they have read and reviewed all nominees
## Key Design Decisions
From the initial strategy goals, the following issues were identified that determined design decisions:
## 1. Teacher Users & Student Users
### Problem: 
Need to have students' work supervised, including their account name and a check on the quality of their reviews.
### Solution:
Have students and teachers as separate 'accounts' by holding each within separate tables, and giving teachers the ability to oversee their associated students' work.
## 2. Relational database
### Problem:
Students need to be created with an association to a teacher, and have limited information available for privacy
### Solution:
Teachers complete initial registration, and then once logged in are able to create students. Each student when added is automatically linked to that teacher's id as a foreign key. The Student's unique detail is their (presumably school) email address, and then teacher can enter a first name and a surname initial. Reviews for general public do not display student's school, so only shows name in First. S format.
In order to achieve this, a relational database management system is required.
## 3. Role concept
### Problem:
Teacher's actions are very different to the students i.e. students will write reviews, but teachers will only be managing and supervising the students' work.
### Solution:
Create a role concept within the database, where the actions page (i.e. Account) is determined by the role id assigned to each user (Teacher role or Student role).
